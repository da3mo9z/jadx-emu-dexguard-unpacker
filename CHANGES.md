# Changes

## 2.1.0

Built against `io.github.flyphantomfly:jadx-emu` 0.2.0 and released under GPLv2. The native-unidbg module and the old CI workflow were dropped, and both are still in the v2.0.0 tag.

The docs and scripts were rewritten after the release. `deploy-engine.sh` now matches the 0.2.0 engine, the smoke-test fixtures are back, `deploy-unidbg.sh` and `WORKSPACE.md` are gone, and the notes about separate 1.x and 2.x engines were removed.

## 2.0.0

Ported to jadx-emu's rewritten hook API (upstream commit ba65619). Recovery, config keys and outputs are the same as 1.0.13. What changed is how the extension talks to the engine: handlers get the running VM, the inline scheduler runs on the VM that dispatched the call, and the engine's diagnostics feed the telemetry. It needs `Hooks.after`, a hook that sees what a call really returned, which is in the engine from 0.2.0.

Checked with the unit tests, 11 end-to-end tests that run real emulated Dalvik, `scripts/smoke.sh` through the real jadx CLI, and FaceTec (4 dex, 421 classDefs, the same four files as 1.0.x). One known problem: the FaceTec sweep took about 12 minutes against about 4 on 1.0.x. Benchmarks ruled out the engine rewrite, `Hooks.after` and the diagnostics sink, and the cause hasn't been found.

## 1.0.13 and earlier

- 1.0.13: `persistHiddenVm` (opt-in) keeps the hidden-dex VM and its static state between stages.
- 1.0.12: an end-to-end pipeline test.
- 1.0.11: a progress line during long sweeps, and `scripts/find-decryptors.sh`.
- 1.0.10: return-value hooks (`addReturn` on engine beta.6). Crypto and decrypt capture now read the real result instead of reproducing it.
- 1.0.9: wider loader coverage: `DelegateLastClassLoader`, in-memory `DexFile`, `addDexPath`, and `InMemoryDexClassLoader` with a single `ByteBuffer`.
- 1.0.8: a readable diagnosis when a run recovers nothing, written to `diagnosis.txt`.
- 1.0.7: an inline scheduler. Thread, Executor and Handler bodies run synchronously in the emulator instead of being denied.
- 1.0.0 to 1.0.6: the first rework of nitanmarcel's original unpacker. AOSP-correct math stubs, a telemetry and config file, crypto capture, multi-stage recovery, a better candidate scanner, the one-click auto-sweep (1.0.2 to 1.0.4) and headless mode through `autoUnpack` (1.0.6).

The 1.x line is frozen at v1.0.13. It needs the older engine and isn't built from this branch.
